# TriangleTest
 One of our assignments in Ohjelmistotestaus (Software Testing). Assignment was to make a test which declares what kind of an triangle are we talking about. There is also an deliberation about the subject (enough tests, what to consider in a testing). Deliberation is (unfortunately) only in Finnish.
